There in a rocking chair sat an elderly woman with a big smile on her face. "I've been expecting you." 
she said weakly. Ruth was one of our Meals On Wheels stops I had arranged; along with the usual church members who enjoyed carolers. 
We handed Ruth the basket of goodies the teens had assembled earlier that evening. Then I asked Ruth what carols she would like to hear. 
Ruth's face was beaming as she joined in singing each song.

As we hugged Ruth good-bye she said to me with tears glistening in her eyes, â€œThe day you called I was still in bed.
