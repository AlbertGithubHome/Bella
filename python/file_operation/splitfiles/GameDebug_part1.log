As we slowly drove down the street on that cold December evening we spotted the porch light. 
"This must be the house." I told our "Positive Teens In Action" group. 
We pulled up in front of an older home with the porch light glowing. 
We gathered up our song books, walked up the steps, and knocked on the door. 
We heard a faint voice from inside say, â€œCome on in. The door is open." We opened the door.
