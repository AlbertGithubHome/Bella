ay, “Come on in. The door is open." We opened the door.

There in a rocking chair sat an elderly woman with a big smile on her face. "I've been expecting you." 
she said weakly. Ruth was one of our Meals On Wheels stops I had arranged; along with the usual church members who enjoyed carolers. 
We handed Ruth the basket of goodies the teens had assembled earlier that evening. Then I asked Ruth what carols she would like to hear. 
Ruth's face was beaming as she joined in singing each song.

As we hugged Ruth good-bye she said to me with tears glistening in her eyes, “The day you called I was still in bed. 
I had just finished praying. I asked God if it would be possible to have some Christmas Carolers come to my home and sing this year. 
Thank you for being the answer to my Christmas prayer."

Wow, what an awesome experience to have the opportunity to be the answer to someone's Christmas prayer.

Bible Text: When you pray, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen.
